# Practice parking with a parking game!

# Description
Different levels of difficulty are provided for each stage, allowing you to practice parking and experience front, rear and parallel parking. You can practice parking from three perspectives.

# Background of project
In the case of parking, it is difficult to find a practice space and practice due to the risk of accidents.

# Expectation
Beginner drivers can learn and learn various parking methods in advance by practicing parallel parking, front and rear parking in advance. I think it's possible to relieve the psychological fear of parking because it's done through a game.
